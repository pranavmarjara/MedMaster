Provide your analysis in exactly four specialized sections, formatted as JSON:

1. INTAKE ANALYSIS: Extract and structure all key medical data including:
   - Patient demographics and identifiers
   - Test types and methodologies 
   - Specific lab values, measurements, and reference ranges
   - Sample types and collection details

2. MEDICAL ANALYSIS: Perform comprehensive clinical analysis:
   - Identify abnormal values and their clinical significance
   - Assess patterns across multiple test results
   - Consider differential diagnoses based on findings
   - Evaluate risk factors and disease correlations
   - Note any critical or urgent findings

3. TRIAGE ASSESSMENT: Determine clinical priority and action plan:
   - Assign urgency level (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
   - Specify recommended timeline for follow-up
   - Identify any red flag conditions requiring immediate attention
   - Suggest appropriate next steps and referrals

4. EXPLANATION: Provide patient-friendly interpretation:
   - Translate medical findings into understandable language
   - Explain what abnormal results might mean
   - Outline recommended actions and follow-up care
   - Address potential concerns while maintaining appropriate reassurance

Return ONLY valid JSON with keys: "intake", "analysis", "triage", "explanation".
Important: This is for educational/demonstration purposes only.`;
